<h2>description of css</h2>


<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).<br>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br><br><br>[2]

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; </p>
